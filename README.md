# HeartCare
Machine Learning Model to predict heart Disease.  
The model used was XGBoostClassifier and it was optimized with Hyperopt.  
This repository includes a presentation of the project in the "PresentationHeartcare.pdf".   
Also, in the test folder there are two python scripts that autofill the app (using Selenium) for a quick demonstration.
